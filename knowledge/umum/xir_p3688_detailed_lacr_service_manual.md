Section 2
MAINTENANCE
1.0 Introduction
This chapter provides details about the following
• Preventive maintenance (inspection and cleaning).
• Safe handling of CMOS and LDMOS devices.
• Repair procedures and techniques
2.0 Preventive Maintenance
Periodic visual inspection and cleaning is recommended.
2.1 Inspection
Check that the external surfaces of the radio are clean, and that all external controls and switches 
are functional. It is not recommended to inspect the interior electronic circuitry.
2.2 Cleaning Procedures
The following procedures describe the recommended cleaning agents and the methods to be used 
when cleaning the external and internal surfaces of the radio. External surfaces include the front 
cover, housing assembly and battery case. These surfaces should be cleaned whenever a periodic 
visual inspection reveals the presence of smudges, grease, and/or grime. 
The only recommended agent for cleaning the external radio surfaces is a 0.5% solution of a mild 
dishwashing detergent in water. The only factory recommended liquid for cleaning the printed circuit 
boards and their components is isopropyl alcohol (100% by volume).
NOTE Internal surfaces should be cleaned only when the radio is disassembled for service or
repair.
The effects of certain chemicals and their vapors can have harmful results on 
certain plastics. Avoid using aerosol sprays, tuner cleaners and other 
chemicals.
!
C a u t i o n

--- Halaman 18 ---
Preventive Maintenance 2-2
Cleaning External Plastic Surfaces
Apply the 0.5% detergent-water solution sparingly with a stiff, non-metallic, short-bristled brush to 
work all loose dirt away from the radio. Use a soft, absorbent, lintless cloth or tissue to remove the 
solution and dry the radio. Make sure that no water remains entrapped near the connectors, cracks, 
or crevices.
Cleaning Internal Circuit Boards and Components
Isopropyl alcohol (100%) may be applied with a stiff, non-metallic, short-bristled brush to dislodge 
embedded or caked materials located in hard-to-reach areas. The brush stroke should direct the 
dislodged material out and away from the inside of the radio. Make sure that controls or tunable 
components are not soaked with alcohol. Do not use high-pressure air to hasten the drying process 
since this could cause the liquid to collect in unwanted places. After completing of the cleaning 
process, use a soft, absorbent, lintless cloth to dry the area. Do not brush or apply any isopropyl 
alcohol to the frame, front cover or back cover.
2.3 Safe Handling of CM OS and LDMOS Devices
Complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) and Laterally Diffused Metal Oxide 
Semiconductor (LDMOS) devices are used in this family of radios, and are susceptible to damage by 
electrostatic or high voltage charges. Damage can be latent, resulting in failures occurring weeks or 
months later. Therefore, special precautions must be taken to prevent device damage during 
disassembly, troubleshooting, and repair. 
Handling precautions are mandatory for CMOS circuits and are especially important in low humidity 
conditions. 
NOTE Always use a fresh supply of alcohol and a clean container to prevent contamination by 
dissolved material (from previous usage).

--- Halaman 19 ---
2-3 Preventive Maintenance
DO NOT attempt to disassemble the radio without first referring to the following CAUTION 
statement.
This radio contains static-sensitive devices. Do not open the radio unless you are 
properly grounded. Take the following precautions when working on this unit:
• Store and transport all CMOS/L DMOS devices in conductive 
material so that all exposed leads are shorted together. Do not insert 
CMOS/LDMOS devices into conventional plastic “snow” trays used 
for storage and transportation of other semiconductor devices.
• Ground the working surface of the service bench to protect the 
CMOS/LDMOS device. We recommend using a wrist strap, two 
ground cords, a table mat, and a floor mat.
• Wear a conductive wrist strap in series with a 100k resistor to 
ground. (Replacement wrist straps that connect to the bench top 
covering are Motorola part number 4280385A59).
• Do not wear nylon clothing while handling CMOS/LDMOS devices.
• Do not insert or remove CMOS/L DMOS devices with power applied. 
Check all power supplies used for testing CMOS/LDMOS devices to 
be certain that there are no voltage transients present.
• When straightening CMOS/LDMOS pins, provide ground straps for 
the apparatus used.
• When soldering, use a grounded soldering iron.
• If at all possible, handle CMOS/LDMOS devices by the package and 
not by the leads. Prior to touching the unit, touch an electrical 
ground to remove any static charge that you may have 
accumulated. The package and substrate may be electrically 
common. If so, the reaction of a discharge to the case would cause 
the same damage as touching the leads.

Repair Procedures and Techniques — General 2-4
3.0 Repair Procedures an d Techniques — General
Any rework or repair on Environmentally Preferred Products must be done using the appropriate 
lead-free solder wire and lead-free solder paste as stated in the following table:
Parts Replacement and Substitution
When damaged parts are replaced, identical parts should be used. If the identical replacement part 
is not locally available, check the parts list for the proper Motorola part number and order the part.
Rigid Circuit Boards
The family of radios uses bonded, multi-layer, printed circuit boards. Since the inner layers are not 
accessible, some special considerations are required when soldering and unsoldering components. 
The printed through holes may interconnect multiple layers of the printed circuit. Therefore, exercise 
care to avoid pulling the plated circuit out of the hole.
When soldering near connector: 
• Avoid accidentally getting solder in the connector. 
• Be careful not to form solder bridges between the connector pins. 
• Examine your work closely for shorts due to solder bridges.
NOTE Environmentally Prefer red Products (EPP) (refer to t he marking on the printed circuit
boards — examples shown below) were developed and assembled using environmen-
tally preferred components and solder assembly techniques to comply with the Euro-
pean Union’s Restriction of Hazardous Substances (ROHS) Directive 2002/95/EC
and Waste Electrical and El ectronic Equipment (W EEE) Directiv e 2002/96/EC . To
maintain product compliance and reliability, us e only the Motorola specified parts in this
manual.

2-5 Repair Procedures and Techniques — General
Chip Components
Use the RLN4062 Hot-Air Repair Station for chip component replacement. Adjust the temperature 
control to 370°C (700°F), and adjust the airflow to a minimum setting. Airflow can vary due to 
component density.
• To remove a chip component: 
1. Use a hot-air hand piece and position the nozzle of the hand piece approximately 0.3 cm
(1/8") above the component to be removed. 
2. Begin applying the hot air. Once the solder reflows, remove the component using a pair of 
tweezers. 
3. Using a solder wick and a soldering iron or a power desoldering station, remove the excess 
solder from the pads.
• To replace a chip component using a soldering iron: 
1. Select the appropriate micro-tipped soldering iron and apply fresh solder to one of the solder 
pads.
2. Using a pair of tweezers, position the new chip component in place while heating the fresh 
solder.
3. Once solder wicks onto the new component, remove the heat from the solder.
4. Heat the remaining pad with the soldering iron and apply solder until it wicks to the 
component. If necessary, touch up the first side. All solder joints should be smooth and shiny.
• To replace a chip component using hot air:
1. Use the hot-air hand piece and reflow the solder on the solder pads to smooth it.
2. Apply a drop of solder paste flux to each pad.
3. Using a pair of tweezers, position the new component in place.
4. Position the hot-air hand piece approximately 0.3 cm (1/8”) above the component and begin 
applying heat.
5. Once the solder wicks to the component, remove the heat and inspect the repair. All joints 
should be smooth and shiny.

General Controller Block 4-2
Section 4
RADIO INFORMATION
1.0 General Controller Block
The controller section is the central interface between the various subsystems of the radio, namely 
PMIC, RF, peripheral and audio CODEC.
The controller section consists of 4 main ICs. These are the microprocessor OMAPL138 Host/DSP 
Processor (U1000), NAND Flash memory (U2100), mDDR memory (U2000), and Power 
Management Unit PMIC (U3003). Microprocessor (U1000) needs only one clock for operation. That is 
19.2 MHz square-wave @ 1.2V pp. 19.2 MHz clock source is provided by TCXO. The power 
management architecture is centered on the PMIC (U3003). A battery supplies power to a 3.6V step 
down regulator which control by an on off state machine. When the radio is turned on, the on/off state 
machine will enable 3.6V switching regulator to power on PMIC. Radio will be turned-off under one of 
three conditions; they are ONB turned off, low battery, or thermal shutdown.

1.1 Audio
The audio processing within the radio can be broken into two separate processes: Receive audio and 
Transmit audio. A block diagram of the audio is shown in  Figure 4-2.
