MAINTENANCE
1.0 Introduction
This chapter provides details about the following:
•
Preventive maintenance (inspection and cleaning)
•
Safe handling of CMOS and LDMOS devices
•
Repair procedures and techniques
•
Pre-baking of Integrated Circuits
2.0 Preventive Maintenance
Periodic visual inspection and cleaning is recommended.
2.1 Inspection
Check that the external surfaces of the radio are clean, and that all external controls and switches 
are functional. It is not recommended to inspect the interior electronic circuitry.
2.2 Cleaning Procedures
The following procedures describe the recommended cleaning agents and the methods to be used 
when cleaning the external and internal surfaces of the radio. External surfaces include the control 
head and housing assembly. These surfaces should be cleaned whenever a periodic visual 
inspection reveals the presence of smudges, grease, and/or grime. 
NOTE: Internal surfaces should be cleaned only when the radio is disassembled for service or repair.
The only recommended agent for cleaning the external radio surfaces is a 0.5% solution of a mild 
dishwashing detergent in water. The only factory recommended liquid for cleaning the printed circuit 
boards and their components is isopropyl alcohol (100% by volume).
Use all chemicals as prescribed by the manufacturer. Be sure to follow all 
safety precautions as defined on the label or material safety data sheet.
The effects of certain chemicals and their vapors can have harmful results on 
certain plastics. Avoid using aerosol sprays, tuner cleaners and other 
chemicals.

2-2 Safe Handling of CMOS and LDMOS Devices
Cleaning External Plastic Surfaces
Apply the 0.5% detergent-water solution sparingly with a stiff, non-metallic, short-bristled brush to 
work all loose dirt away from the radio. Use a soft, absorbent, lintless cloth or tissue to remove the 
solution and dry the radio. Make sure that no water remains entrapped near the connectors, cracks, 
or crevices.
Cleaning Internal Circuit Boards and Components
Isopropyl alcohol (100%) may be applied with a stiff, non-metallic, short-bristled brush to dislodge 
embedded or caked materials located in hard-to-reach areas. The brush stroke should direct the 
dislodged material out and away from the inside of the radio. Make sure that controls or tunable 
components are not soaked with alcohol. Do not use high-pressure air to hasten the drying process 
since this could cause the liquid to collect in unwanted places. Once the cleaning process is 
complete, use a soft, absorbent, lintless cloth to dry the area. Do not brush or apply any isopropyl 
alcohol to the frame, control head and housing assembly.
NOTE: Always use a fresh supply of alcohol and a clean container to prevent contamination by 
dissolved material (from previous usage).
3.0 Safe Handling of CM OS and LDMOS Devices
Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) and Laterally Diffused Metal Oxide 
Semiconductor (LDMOS) devices are used in this family of radios, and are susceptible to damage by 
electrostatic or high voltage charges. Damage can be latent, resulting in failures occurring weeks or 
months later. Therefore, special precautions must be taken to prevent device damage during 
disassembly, troubleshooting, and repair. 
Handling precautions are mandatory for CMOS/LDMOS circuits and are especially important in low 
humidity conditions. 

--- Halaman 21 ---
Safe Handling of CMOS and LDMOS Devices 2-3
DO NOT attempt to disassemble the radio without first referring to the following CAUTION 
statement.
This radio contains static-sensitive devices. Do not open the radio unless you are 
properly grounded. Take the following precautions when working on this unit:
• Store and transport all CMOS/L DMOS devices in conductive 
material so that all exposed leads are shorted together. Do not insert 
CMOS/LDMOS devices into conventional plastic “snow” trays used 
for storage and transportation of other semiconductor devices.
• Ground the working surface of the service bench to protect the 
CMOS/LDMOS device. We recommend using a wrist strap, two 
ground cords, a table mat, a floor mat, ESD shoes, and an ESD 
chair.
• Wear a conductive wrist strap in series with a 100k resistor to 
ground. (Replacement wrist straps that connect to the bench top 
covering are Motorola part number 4280385A59).
• Do not wear nylon clothing while handling CMOS/LDMOS devices.
• Do not insert or remove CMOS/LDMOS devices with power applied. 
Check all power supplies used for testing CMOS/LDMOS devices to 
be certain that there are no voltage transients present.
• When straightening CMOS/LDMOS pins, provide ground straps for 
the apparatus used.
• When soldering, use a grounded soldering iron.
• If at all possible, handle CMOS/LDMOS devices by the package and 
not by the leads. Prior to touching the unit, touch an electrical 
ground to remove any static charge that you may have 
accumulated. The package and substrate may be electrically 
common. If so, the reaction of a discharge to the case would cause 
the same damage as touching the leads.

2-4 Repair Procedures and Techniques – General
4.0 Repair Procedures and Techniques – General
Any rework or repair on Environmentally Preferred Products must be done using the appropriate 
lead-free solder wire and lead-free solder paste as stated in the following table:
Parts Replacement and Substitution
Check the parts list for the proper Motorola part number and order the part from the nearest 
Motorola Radio Products and Solutions Organization listed in Appendix A of this manual.
Rigid Circuit Boards
This family of radios uses bonded, multi-layer, printed circuit boards. Since the inner layers are not 
accessible, some special considerations are required when soldering and unsoldering components. 
The printed through holes may interconnect multiple layers of the printed circuit. Therefore, exercise 
care to avoid pulling the plated circuit out of the hole.
When soldering near a connector: 
•
Avoid accidentally getting solder in the connector 
•
Be careful not to form solder bridges between the connector pins 
•
Examine your work closely for shorts due to solder bridges
For soldering components with Hot-Air or infra red solder systems, please check your user guide of 
the solder system to get information on solder temperature and time for the different housings of the 
integrated circuits and other components.
NOTE
Environmentally Preferred Prod ucts (EPP) (refer to the marking on the printed circuit
boards – examples shown below) were developed and assembled using environmentally
preferred components and solder assembly  techniques to comply with the European
Union’s Restriction of Hazardous Substances (ROHS 2) Directive 2011/65/EU 
and
Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (W EEE) Directive 2012/19/EU
. To
maintain product compliance and reliability, use only the Motorola specified parts in this
manual.

Pre-baking of Integrated Circuits 2-5
5.0 Pre-baking of Integrated Circuits
Electronic components are generally coated with plastic material which has the nature of not being 
waterproof. If kept unsealed, the components can absorb humidity. When soldered to the board 
(especially with reflow techniques) a sudden change in temperature can cause fissures or cracks 
which can result in malfunction or damage. Therefore, service should temper in a Desiccant Cabinet 
(12 hours at 50 degree Celsius) the radio PCB, before heating up areas around MS components.
To avoid this problem, these Moisture Sensitive (MS) components should be stored and shipped in a 
sealed wrapping (dry pack). Processing must take place only with dry components when an 
uninterrupted dry storage can be guaranteed, otherwise the components have to be pre-baked.
If a reflow procedure takes place close to MS components the whole board must be pre-baked.

If the actual MET is less than 24 hours, the soak time ma y be reduced. For soak conditions of 30 °C/60% RH, the
soak time is reduced by 1 hour for each hour the MET is less than 24 hours. For soak conditions of 60 °C/60% RH,
the soak time is reduced by 1 hour for each 5 hours the MET is less than 24 hours.
If the actual MET is greater than 24 hours the soak time  must be increased. If soak conditions are 30 °C/60% RH,
the soak time is increased 1 hour for each hour that the actual MET exceeds 24 hours. If soak conditions are 
60 °C/60% RH, the soak time is increased 1 hour for each 5 hours that the actual MET exceeds 24 hours.
